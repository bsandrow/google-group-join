google-group-join
=================

You can join a Google Group without having a Google ID, but it's not very
apparent, and I end up having to search for the instructions every time that I
do it. This is an attempt to codify it so that I can 'set it and forget it.'

After running this command, the sign-up process will be initiated and Google
Groups will send you confirmation email.

Usage
=====

    google-group-join my.google.group me@example.com
